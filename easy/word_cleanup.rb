# CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:
# You have a list of words. Letters of these words are mixed with extra symbols, so it is hard to define the beginning and end of each word. Write a program that will clean up the words from extra numbers and symbols.
#
# INPUT SAMPLE:
# The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test case with a list of words: letters are both lowercase and uppercase, and are mixed with extra symbols.
# For example:
# (--9Hello----World...--)
# Can 0$9 ---you~
# 13What213are;11you-123+138doing7
#
# OUTPUT SAMPLE:
# Print the cleaned up words separated by spaces in lowercase letters.
# For example:
# hello world
# can you
# what are you doing
#
# CONSTRAINTS:
# Print the words separated by spaces in lowercase letters.
# The length of a test case together with extra symbols can be in a range from 10 to 100 symbols.
# The number of test cases is 40.
